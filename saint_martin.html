      <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>Saint Martin was discovered by Christopher Columbus, who claimed the land for Spain in 1493. However, the Dutch occupied the land in 1631 in order to use the island for its salt deposits. The island was retaken by the Spanish in 1633, but they eventually relinquished control to the French and Dutch, whom split the island evenly amongst themselves in 1648. Infighting ensued, and the border frequently fluctuated after the Spanish relinquished their power over the island. Eventually, the border stopped moving, and the French controlled about 61% of the island.</p>

        <p>African slaves were brought to the island in the late 18th century, and slavery wasn't abolished on the island until 1848. As a result, the island's agriculture industry and its production declined rapidly, causing Saint Martin to become a free port in 1939. In the 1970s and 80s, Saint  Martin sought to expand its tourism industry, focusing on heavy urban development and abandoning its long-standing reliance on agriculture.</p>

        <p>Due to a vote by the residents of Saint Martin, the island seceded from Guadeloupe in 2003 and the north half of the island became a French overseas collectivity in 2007. Furthermore, the southern half, which was controlled by the Dutch, became the independent nation of Sint Maarten within the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 2010.</p>

        <P>Saint Martin's <a href="https://www.st-martin.org/us/discover/history?dt=1632276925602">official website</a> gives detailed outlines on the both the history of the island and its economy over the years.</p>
