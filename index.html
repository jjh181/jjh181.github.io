    <h2>A Little About Myself</h2>

    <p>Hi. My name is Jared. I'm a Junior from Long Island, New York, and I find interest in just about everything. Some of my most passionate hobbies are music, a field in which I am currently pursuing a career in (particularly the business side of things), as well as photography and coding. I attend the University of Miami, majoring in Business Analytics and minoring in Media Management. When I'm not teaching myself new skills or finding new interests, I like to explore, especially in Manhattan, where there's never NOT something to do or see. Below, I will dive deeper into my passions, particularly music and photography. Thanks for stopping by and getting to know a little bit more about me.</p>

    <h2>Photography</h2>
    <p>Aside from going to concerts, I love to take pictures. I prefer to use my DSLR (I have a Nikon D3300), but I can be pretty handy with a phone camera in a pinch. My favorite subjects are nature scenes, as well as action shots, particularly at the concerts I go to as well as the sporting events I attend. Additionaly, the radio station on the UM campus, WVUM 90.5, often has me take photos for them. Most of my photos wind up on my Instagram, but if they do not, they often appear elsewhere, such as my Twitter or even as the wallpaper on my computer.</p>
