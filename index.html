    <h2>A Little About Myself</h2>
    
    <p>Hi. My name is Jared. I'm a junior from Long Island, New York, and I find interest in just about everything. Some of my most passionate hobbies are music, a field in which I am currently pursuing a career in (particularly the business side of things), as well as photography and coding. I attend the University of Miami, majoring in Business Analytics and minoring in Media Management. When I'm not teaching myself new skills or finding new interests, I like to explore, especially in Manhattan, where there's never NOT something to do or see. Below, I will dive deeper into my passions, particularly music and photography. Thanks for stopping by and getting to know a little bit more about me.</p>
